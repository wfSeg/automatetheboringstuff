README

To commit changes or create a repository thing.
1. Log into Github first, create your repo, get the https:// url for the repo
2. In sublime, get used to the CTRL+SHIFT+P for the command pallete
3. CTRL+SHIFT+P do GIT INIT (first time only), hit ENTER a bunch of times
4. If it ask for the name, use master or origin I dunno, haven't read up on git etiquette yet.
5. Enter in the github URL for your repo, that you created earlier in step 1
6. For the project, any and all files, do GIT ADD, then select files (or scroll down and add all) - adds file to 'staging'
		Use Quick ADD.. I don't see any other ADD
7. GIT COMMIT - add a commit message up top, close window to save. This adds file from 'staging' to 'commit stage...?'
8. GIT PUSH - push changes to github repo. That's it. 

I don't know about branches and version control, but probably have to read up on that once I start touching other people's code on the company's gitlab :| #pray4meP

This is cool and all, but now I need to figure out how to run python in sublime, so I don't have to open up the IDLE shell
